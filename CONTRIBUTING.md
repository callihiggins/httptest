## Contributing

#### Contributing is simple:

1. Create a branch off of master
1. Add as many commits as you like
1. Push the branch, and open a PR
1. Keep adding commits until you're ready
1. Assign someone from [delivery engineering][dv] to indicate that you'd like
1 review
1. Be patient, or ping the reviewer on Slack if it's urgent
1. Respond to comments by pushing more commits or simply explaining
1. After the required approval, let the reviewer (or the submitter if from
delivery engineering) click the merge button

#### Guidelines:

* This is basically [GitHub Flow][ghf].
* Follow [Tim Pope's advice][tpa] on commit messages.
* Don't merge a PR unless you're assigned, but feel free to comment.
* Push early and often, so your colleagues can see what you're working on.
* Rebase and force push as often as you like. It's your branch.
