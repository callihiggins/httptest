## Contributing

#### Contributing is simple:

1. Create a branch off of master
1. Add as many commits as you like
1. Push the branch, and open a PR
1. Keep adding commits until you're ready
1. Assign someone from [delivery engineering][dv] to indicate that you'd like
a review
1. Be patient, or ping the reviewer on Slack if it's urgent
1. Respond to comments by pushing more commits or simply explaining
1. Once the reviewer has approved the PR:
  * merge it yourself if you have access
  * have the reviewer merge
1. Delete the branch

#### Guidelines:

* Master is protected to block pushes directly to master, and merges without
approvals.
* The number of approvals required should be determined by the reviewer
* This is basically [GitHub Flow][ghf].
* Follow [Tim Pope's advice][tpa] on commit messages.
* Push early and often, so your colleagues can see what you're working on.
* Rebase and force push as often as you like. It's your branch.
* Avoid long running branches
